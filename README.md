## Gameplay

The game always starts with the AI's turn (to make it a bit more challenging ;)).

To make your move just click on a free spot. The AI responds after a few milliseconds.
If your first move was not in the center, then the game is already lost.

The AI will test out every possible move before playing, always striving for a win or a draw.

As the AI has the first turn playing and never plays incorrectly, this game is unwinnable.
